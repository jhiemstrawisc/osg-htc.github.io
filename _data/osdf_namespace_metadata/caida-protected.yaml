  Founded in 1997, the Center for Applied Internet Data Analysis (CAIDA) conducts network research and
  builds research infrastructure to support large-scale data collection, curation, and data distribution
  to the scientific research community. CAIDA is based at the San Diego Supercomputer Center, located on
  the UC San Diego campus in La Jolla, CA.

  CAIDA investigates practical and theoretical aspects of the Internet in order to:
  - provide macroscopic insights into Internet infrastructure, behavior, usage, and evolution,
  - foster a collaborative environment in which data can be acquired, analyzed, and (as appropriate) shared,
  - improve the integrity of the field of Internet science,
  - inform science, technology, and communications public policies.
